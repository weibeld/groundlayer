## CI/CD

CI/CD is the fuel of a DevOps system—it is what keeps the code moving from your devs to your users.

We work with a wide range of CI/CD solutions, such as Jenkins, CircleCI, Drone, Buddy, Buildkite, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, Spinnaker, Tekton, Argo CD, and Flux.

CI/CD can easily grow out of hand, but we think that it should be simple. Nobody likes to debug spaghetti pipelines! We can help you creating a system that’s well-designed from the ground up, and that people like to work with!

## Cloud

Cloud platforms have become the natural environment for many infrastructure components and services.

We work with all of the major cloud providers, AWS, GCP, and Azure. We use Infrastructure as Code (e.g. Terraform, Pulumi) and configuration management (e.g. Ansible, Salt) as a matter of course.

We can help you realising a cloud strategy that optimally fits your software ecosystem. This may include hybrid and multi-cloud approaches, as well as full automation and repeatability for managing your cloud resources.

## Cloud-Native Transformation

Are you cloud-native yet? Cloud-native doesn't mean just moving stuff to the cloud. It’s a set of principles centred around the mantra that services and infrastructure should be treated as cattle rather than as pets.

This way of thinking has tremendous effects on flexibility and efficiency. It affects the entire software lifecycle, from how apps are exposed to how they are written.

We can assist you in this cloud-native journey with our wide knowledge of cloud-native principles, best practices, and tools.

## Container Orchestration

Container orchestration is the engine of a modern DevOps system, and Kubernetes is the leading container orchestrator.

We are Kubernetes enthusiasts and work with both Kubernetes services such as GKE, EKS, and AKS, and distributions such as Rancher and OpenShift. This extends to related tools such as Docker, Helm, Istio, Linkerd, and networking and storage plugins.

We can help you making the best use of Kubernetes for your situation, including migrations to Kubernetes and containerisation of existing applications.

## Observability

Observability includes metrics monitoring, log management, and tracing.

We work with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Elastic, fluentd, Zipkin, and Jaeger. We also strive to leverage these tools for self-adaptation and self-healing.

You deserve to know with certainty what's going on in your system, and if something goes wrong, processes should be in place to fix the situation with the least possible damage. We can help you achieving exactly this with our extensive experience in observability topics.

## Process Optimisation

Are your software delivery processes efficient? Are you using the right tools for the job? Are there redundancies or bottlenecks?

More often than not, DevOps processes grow organically and end up in a suboptimal shape. We can provide a fresh look on your infrastructure, identify the weak spots, and come up with a clean alternative design.

Our goal is simplicity and efficiency. We can help you creating processes that get the job done with the least amount of fuss and that you can use as a base to build upon.
